# Advanced Calculator

A web-based advanced calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The application performs both basic and advanced mathematical operations with proper rounding and error handling.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Power and n-th root calculations
- Results rounded to two decimal places
- Division-by-zero error handling
- Modular and reusable JavaScript functions
- Clean and simple user interface

- ## How to Use
1. Open the `Complex Calculator.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Enter values into the two input fields labelled Number 1 and Number 2.
3. Select the desired operation using the provided buttons.
4. The result will be displayed in the Result field.
5. For division, the calculator prevents division by zero and displays an error message.
6. Power calculates Number 1 raised to the power of Number 2.
7. Root calculates the n-th root of Number 1, where n is Number 2.


## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

## How It Works
- The user inputs two numbers
- JavaScript functions retrieve and process the inputs
- Results are rounded to two decimal places using `toFixed(2)`
- Errors such as division by zero are handled gracefully

## Example
Number 1 = 10
Number 2 = 3
Division result: 3.33


## Future Improvements
- Keyboard input support
- Calculation history
- Scientific calculator functions
- Dark and light mode toggle
